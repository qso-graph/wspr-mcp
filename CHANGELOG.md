# Changelog

All notable changes to `wspr-mcp` are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

- **ruff and mypy run in CI** (qso-graph-devel#66), as a job the `ci-all-green` gate requires.
  Settings follow `adif-mcp`, the reference for every qso-graph Python repo, rather than a style of
  this repo's own. They run once rather than per Python version: both read the source, and neither
  answer changes with the interpreter.
- Both path-band lists are annotated. Their rows mix strings, ints, floats and lists, so an
  unannotated comprehension infers `dict[str, object]` and the `total_spots` sum beneath it cannot
  read its own rows. The ClickHouse row list is typed where it leaves `json.loads`.
- `E501` is deferred rather than adopted (qso-graph-devel#70): what it reports in these repos are
  widths, not defects, and some lines are long because they name a publisher's field exactly.
- `mcp.run` is given the literal fastmcp asks for rather than a `str` that happens to hold the
  right word.
- **The published contact is `maintainers@qso-graph.io`** (qso-graph-devel#69). The `authors` field
  carried a personal address, and that field is what PyPI shows on the package page. The project
  has had outside contributions; a project address is the fitting route for them.

## [0.3.5] — 2026-10-07

- LICENSE: the full GPL-3.0 text. The file held only its opening and a link, so GitHub detected no licence.

## [0.3.4] — 2026-10-06

- PyPI: the Documentation link goes to this package's own page, https://qso-graph.io/servers/wspr/ (qso-graph/.github#15).
- CI: the release flow (qso-graph/.github TEMPLATES.md). Work lands on `develop`; a release is a
  PR from `develop` into `main`, and merging it publishes to PyPI and the MCP Registry, verifies both
  and tags the release. CI runs on `develop` too, and PRs into `main` must come from `develop` or a
  `security/` branch.

## [0.3.3] — 2026-09-28

### Added (CI hygiene)

- **MCP Registry sync** — `publish.yml` publishes to the [Official MCP Registry](https://registry.modelcontextprotocol.io)
  after each PyPI publish, using GitHub OIDC for auth. Triggered on
  `v*` tag push; no manual steps. The Registry job waits until PyPI
  serves the version, and retries. Pattern documented in
  [qso-graph/.github/TEMPLATES.md](https://github.com/qso-graph/.github/blob/main/TEMPLATES.md).
- **Registry version badge** in README — PyPI and Registry versions
  are visible side-by-side so any drift between publishing surfaces
  is immediately apparent.
- **Release gates** — the tag must match `pyproject.toml`, and a
  `verify` job fails the release unless PyPI and the MCP Registry
  both serve the new version.

### Fixed

- The Official MCP Registry listed wspr-mcp at 0.1.1. This release brings it current.

## [0.3.2] — 2026-05-15

### Added
- New tool `get_version_info` — returns `{service_name, service_version, spec_version}`
  for fleet identity attestation. Lets agents detect version drift across MCP
  deployments without going outside the protocol. Tracks
  [IONIS-AI/ionis-devel#49](https://github.com/IONIS-AI/ionis-devel/issues/49)
  (fleet rollout).
- `__spec_version__` constant in package `__init__.py`, pinned to `wspr-live-v1`
  for the current wspr.live ClickHouse schema.
- L2 unit tests WSPR-L2-046 through WSPR-L2-050 covering the new tool.
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — PR-gating CI workflow (py3.10-3.13 matrix,
  unit + security tests, ci-all-green aggregator).

### Changed
- `__init__.py` modernized to mirror the `adif-mcp`/`solar-mcp` pattern
  (`Final` types, explicit `PackageNotFoundError` handling).
