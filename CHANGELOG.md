## [0.3.2] — 2026-05-15

### Added
- New tool `get_version_info` — returns `{service_name, service_version, spec_version}`
  for fleet identity attestation. Lets agents detect version drift across MCP
  deployments without going outside the protocol. Tracks
  [IONIS-AI/ionis-devel#49](https://github.com/IONIS-AI/ionis-devel/issues/49)
  (fleet rollout).
- `__spec_version__` constant in package `__init__.py`, pinned to `wspr-live-v1`
  for the current wspr.live ClickHouse schema.
- L2 unit tests WSPR-L2-046 through WSPR-L2-050 covering the new tool.
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — PR-gating CI workflow (py3.10-3.13 matrix,
  unit + security tests, ci-all-green aggregator).

### Changed
- `__init__.py` modernized to mirror the `adif-mcp`/`solar-mcp` pattern
  (`Final` types, explicit `PackageNotFoundError` handling).

## [0.3.1] — Previous release
